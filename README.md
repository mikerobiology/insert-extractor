Insert Extractor
================

**Minimum Operation:**  A program that can evaluate a sequence of DNA against a vector sequence and successfully remove the vector sequence, returning only the insert sequence.

**Future Considerations:**
* Ability to run multiple samples at once
* Django Web App
* Store/import new vectors
* Locate/utilize restriction enzyme locations in lieu of vector file
